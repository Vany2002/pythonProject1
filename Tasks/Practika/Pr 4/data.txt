I have many favourite artists. Among them are writers, painters and musicians. When I have free time I often read my favourite books or listen to my favourite music. When I have a spare day, I sometimes visit Kiev Museum of Russian Art. I like the museum, for there are many masterpieces there. But the most interesting works for me are the paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky.
